\section{Introduction}

During their second year at the ENSIAME (Engineering National Higher Institute in Computing, Automation, Mechanics, Energetics, and Electronics), the students must complete an internship that gives them the possibility to put into practice the knowledge they acquired in their first year.

\bigskip

This report is about the four-month internship I completed at Lambert Aircraft Engineering at the Wevelgem-Kortrijk airport in Belgium. This SME of nine employees is currently improving and developping the Mission M108, a single engine light aircraft which was the central task of the placement.

\bigskip

It will first give a brief introduction of the company and the major challenges it is facing today. It will then go on to describe the project and the team that I joined. The third section examines my contribution and tries to draw an objective analysis of the results compared to the expectations. Finally, it will describe the various things learned throughout the internship and how it matched my expectations.

\section{Lambert Aircraft Engineering}

\subsection{Presentation of the company}

%photo of the company

The company was created by Filip and Steven LAMBERT in 1996 and is specialized in limited series production of aircrafts and in avionics maintenance. Thanks to the agreements FAA Part 145 and EASA Part M Subpart F, Lambert Aircraft Engineering is authorized to sell and install avionics products on any kind of aircrafts like Dynon, Garmin or Avidyne products.

\bigskip

The avionics workshop sells classic avionics products like headsets, GPS, transponders and so on. It sells pilot accessories, for instance %TODO: translate gilet de sauvetage, rapporteurs d'angle et cartes aéronautiques. It is also possible to design a new instrument panel for aircrafts and helicopters.

\bigskip

%TODO: diagram of the employees (Manager, 1 design engineer, 1 accountant (secretary?), 3 technicians in mechanical department, 3 in avionics department).
Decisions are taken quickly and information flows at a fast pace thanks to the simple but effective structure of the team.  There are different nationalities among the staff, and the company is very open minded in this respect.

\bigskip

Aviation is an international environment. Lambert Aircraft Engineering does business with France, Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The economy has been very weak since 2009 because of the economy crisis and this makes things more difficult. On the aircrafts market the crisis is "noticeable", there a not many aircrafts selled anymore. But for the avionics market, it is still going very well.

\subsection{Vocabulary} %TODO choose something sexier
\subsubsection{LSA certifications}
\paragraph{ASTM: American Society for Testing and Materials}
The Light Sport Aircraft (LSA) certification has been created by the ASTM in 2003 for aircraft with these following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
\item Maximal speed : 120 kt (22km/h)
\item Maximal wieght: 600kg
\item Engine with pistons
\item Maximum 2 seats
\item Propeller (à pas fixe ou variable réglable au sol)
\item Landing gears "fixes"
\item Non-pressurized cabin
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

Building aircrafts certified LSA as amateur or professionnal is standardized (find something else) with the ASTM F-37 standard.

\paragraph{EASA: European Agency for Safety Aviation}
The LSA standard from ASTM International is partially accepted by the EASA that refuses series production of light sport aircrafts in Europe. However, it allows amateurs to build one, under condition of being certified by the host country of the aircraft. This requires Lambert Aircraft Engineering to sell the Mission M108 LSA kit in Europe to homebuilders.

\paragraph{FAA: Federal Aviation Administration}
The LSA standard from ASTM is totally accepted by the FAA and allows series and amateur production of light sport aircrafts. The core task of Lambert Aircraft Engineering is to produce M108 to the USA in series.

\subsubsection{STC's and LSTC's}
LSTC =! STC (Supplemental Type Certificate)

\subsubsection{Part number system in the company} %TODO something sexier
PART NUMBER (Aircraft, group, material code, part number, revision)


\subsection{The M108 LSA production}
The Mission M108 is a two-seats single engine light sport aircraft. It is in the final stages of development and heading for certification. With the new Rotax 912iS engine installation, the design of systems is reviewed and rethought. Internal documents for production, design and avionics departments have to be updated, such as parts lists and 2D production drawings. External documents provided with the LSA kit to the customer in Europe, for instance the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH), the Illustrated Parts Catalog (IPC) and the Aircraft Assembly Manual (AAM) are to be completed in parallel with the production of the first M108.

\bigskip

Employees are currently focused on the certification of the Mission M108. Technicians and engineers are working in coordination: when a part is created, the engineer has to draw it and sometimes improve it for better mechanical characteristics. There is no "boudary" between the production and the design teams and I was part of the design team, following the production department in order to be aware of design changes and draw or update new parts for the aicraft.

\newpage

\section{Contribution to the project}
\subsection{CAD and design work}

In order to know better about the functionning of the plane, I was assigned to draw some schematics for the Pilot's Operating Handbook. This manual explains how to maintain the aircraft in case of malfunction. This first job allowed me to get acquainted with AutoCAD and prepare myself for the future designs to come. 

%TODO: pictures of the schematics (fuel system and electrical system)

\bigskip

I also schematized the instrument panel for the Pilot's Operating Handbook to have a global view of the cabin.
%TODO: picture of the instrument panel (2D)

\bigskip

I updated partslists and 2D drawings in case of design modifications, and drew some parts when it was necessary. I will take the example of parts from the radiator and the cabin heating system for explaining my contribution, but I worked on others systems in the meantime.
%TODO: picture of the radiator brackets
Designing radiator brackets seemed essential for the Mission M108 because of the original installation. Nothing could match the expectations so brackets have been machined and bent for a first try. I drew and improve them in order to be a perfect fit with the baffles.
%TODO: picture of the general assembly of the radiator.

\bigskip

The cabin heating system is an optional feature. It is installed on the firewall, on the engine side. We needed two brackets to mount bowden cables to open or close the valves to heat or not the cabin. These brackets are riveted to the mounting plate and have different lengths. Since we cannot afford to reverse those two, I decided to change the dimensions of the holes for rivets on the brackets and on the mounting plate. This mistake-proofing system prevent human errors for an assembly inaccuracy.
%TODO: picture of the two brackets + picture of the assembly

\bigskip

In parallel with the 2D drawings production, I drew 3D drawings for the Illustrated Parts Catalog (IPC). Since Lambert Aircraft Engineering sells the aircraft in kit in Europe to homebuilders, they have the IPC to explain step by step how to assemble correctly the aircraft with every part referenced.
%TODO: picture of a 3D drawing

\bigskip

I completed the sections concerning the firewall forward installation, the fuel system and the cabin heating system. I worked first on these sections because I knew how it was working thanks to the schematics. I also had to update sometimes others sections because of design modifications in the meantime.
%TODO: picture of the F4 and S4 IPC

\bigskip

I then created all the IPC structure and the 3D drawings for the electrical, Pitot and statics, and brake systems.
The electrical system is very complex because it depends on the choice of avionics products the customer wants, and the Supplemental Type Certificate he would like to have. I needed to find a logical structure which can group the common equipment, and separate every option to keep it as simple as possible.
%TODO: picture of the 1-S2 IPC structure
%TODO: picture of the instrument panel (3D)

\bigskip

The Pitot and static systems are not new, but there was no partslist and assembly drawings for that. According with the production, I created the partslist in coordination with the previous installations.
%TODO: picture of the 1-S5 IPC

The brake system was an important part of the internship. The 2D and 3D drawings already exist but for the tailwheel version.
%TODO: explain how the tailwheel version works.
In coordination with the design and the production teams, we designed the new brake system but for a nosewheel version. This was totally provisional and the design work has been done at the same time as the installation.
%TODO: picture of the 1-S6 IPC (0051-00)

We also thought that the splitter would have been installed directly at the outlet of the master brake cylinder. Indeed, the hydraulic lines are bought depending on the quantity, not the length. This design change can save 300 euros.
%TODO: picture of the splitter
%TODO: picture of the previous position of the spliiter
%TODO: picture of the new position of the splitter
%TODO: picture of the 1-S6 IPC (0051-01)
The first M108 will be provided with the first version of the brakes but the next will have the splitter installed on the master brake cylinder.
%TODO: refer to 2D drawings and partslist in annexe

\subsection{Database}
LAMS (signification?) is a new database recently created and still updated which will be used by the company. It will reference every part of the aircrafts by the part number.
%TODO: refer to the vocabulary section for the part number
Still experimental, I was assigned to test this database as a user in order to check for mistakes and improve it.

\subsubsection{Description of the database}
Status: production/provisional/withdrawn/... and definition
Type: full assembly/assembly/part bought/part made/... and definition
Reference each part by the part number without the material code (example)
Parts already ready to be ordered (example: TRIG TT21?)
Parts embedded: part which could be welded on the fuselage for example. It is available for the production but then, it is not possible to order it separately.
%TODO: structure of the database

We chose to test the database with the 1-S6 section (brake system). The partslist is quite complete and will not change soon. We also have different kinds of parts in this section and a little design change, we thus have two revisions. The brake system seemed to be the best section to have some experiments with the database.
%TODO: structure of the brake system assembly

\subsubsection{What it needs improved}
Little problems: strings too short sometimes for the description (status, material...)
Significant problems: LSTC structure: how to have a logical structure for an assembly but also with the embedded LSTC's we can have? (example of the 1-S2 section)
%TODO: structure of the 1-S2 IPC
We need to be able to find easily ALL the parts needed for a LSTC. For example, if we take the example of the LSTC 1-007 (which corresponds to the optional cabin heating system for the M108 aircraft), we should be able to know what parts we have in stock or if we need to order some of them and what parts we need to make ourselves.
This should also be available for embedded LSTC's: for instance, LSTC's 1-014 to 1-017 (radio, xpdr, com, autopilot) are only available for LSTC 1-013 (which corresponds to the TL panel).

%TODO: present the design of interior panels for cabin and my future work on that

\newpage

\section{Results}
\subsection{Evaluation of my contribution}
  "I was pleased to see that even though I was an intern, I was assigned tasks that give a valuable contribution to the company. When my internship ended, all the documents and projects I had to work on were implemented and functional."
%TODO: maybe not the design project, we will see

\subsection{Technical knowledge acquired}
"This was also an opportunity for me to acquire some knowledge on a large panel of technologies"
%TODO: how an aircraft work on every aspect : mechanics (fuel, engine, cooling systems, trim control... but also the production) avionics (ECU, autopilot (pitch & roll servos), avionics shelf...)

\newpage

\section{Conclusion}
Lambert Aircraft Engineering is specialized in limited series production of aircrafts and in avionics maintenance. The objective of the internship was mainly to complete the documentation in parallel with the production of the first M108 with a new engine and in preparation of limited series production. I was part of the design team, following the production department in order to be aware of design changes and draw or update new parts for the aicraft.

\bigskip

The amount of tasks that were assigned to me, as well as their importance, was rewarding and made me feel valuable for the company. I worked on very challenging problems that deal with a large set of technologies, going from production drawings in 2D and 3D, database to design of the interior panels for cabin. I worked closely with other engineers and technicians that were eager to assist and help me with any concern I had.

\bigskip

This internship confirmed my desire to specialize in aeronautical engineering but also developed my attraction to materials and welded structures. Working with talented, experienced engineers gave me a good understanding of what is to be expected for a engineer. The qualities that stroke me the most are: passion for aviation, willingness to leverage existing products and tools, being able to take decisions quickly, trying new technologies, and more generally getting things done!

\bigskip

I would like to thank Filip for giving me the opportunity to work on such an amazing project. I also would like to give a special thanks to Steven Lambert and Brecht Declerck for taking the time every day to help me and answer all my questions during those four months. Finally, I want to express my gratitude to all the members of the company for "giving me some of their time, trusting me and letting me work in a very nice and friendly environment. It was a pleasure working with all of you." %TODO: review the structure of this sentence
